Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK) Chairman Mustafa Özçelik was interviewed by Mesopotamian Agency (MA).

Özçelik said that the AKP-MHP alliance must be countered in the 24 June elections but he warned that “we have to stand against this alliance as Kurdish and Kurdistan people. But we have to be very careful and make sure our people do not vote for the CHP or the Iyi Parti (Good Party) as they are hardly clean”.

Özçelik said that Kurds, wherever they find themselves, being it Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria, should form a united front. Unity, he said, will give Kurds much more strength.

Including Kirkuk and Afrin (which has recently been invaded by Turkey) to this new necessary alliance, Özçelik said that the basis for a national alliance should be finally lied.

‘We are ready for cooperation’ 

Özçelik said: "We, as PAK, want to state very clearly that we are ready to get into an alliance with any party that will accept our minimum national democratic demands. To those who accept our demand, who say ’No’ to war and the State of Emergency (OHAL), those who defend freedom, democracy, justice we say that we are ready to work together in order to maximise results in the elections”.

Özçelik ended the interview by saying that the proposals of a “Kurdish Election Bloc” would strengthen the basis for an alliance in the long run.
