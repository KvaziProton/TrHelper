As electoral campaign continues at a fast pace, the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) will announce its election manifesto in Ankara on Monday.

The HDP will publish two manifestos, one for parliamentary and the other for presidential elections. These manifestos will put emphasis on the “transitional period” and “democratization”.

A declaration by HDP Presidential candidate, Selahattin Demirtaş will be read first at the meeting where candidates campaign will be presented. Promotion materials for both the Presidential candidate and the HDP candidates to the National Assembly, will be presented. The party’s statement of intentions will then be read.

The two manifestos are being elaborated on the same framework and in fact complement each other. The context is that of a Turkey now in a “dark period” and which alternatives are proposed by the HDP to exit such a period.

The Manifestos will also underline how the HDP provide a powerful alternative for social opposition to be able to get Turkey out of this dark time.

The Presidential campaign will turn around the ideas of "transitional period" and "democratization" which will be elaborated and turned into concrete proposals.
