HDP Co-Chair Pervin Buldan kicked off the election campaign in Izmir.

Buldan met the democratic people organisations at the Tepekule Congress Center in Izmir. Buldan in her speech noted that Turkey is experiencing a crisis period in every field.

She added: “We arrived at a point in which Turkey is witnessing an economic, political and social crisis and this is matter of concern to all of us. Turkey is living a period of persecution of the society carried out by the AKP government. The crisis has brought nothing but chaos to the country. Turkey’s society is living a repression at the hands of the AKP, no different from that lived under previous governments: Kurds, women, children and young people have constantly been subjected to repression. But we will bring the AKP to account”.

Buldan pointed out that the AKP has tried to win every election with irregularities and added: “We have seen what happened in the past, but today is not yesterday. The AKP government will try to benefit from the State of Emergency proclaimed after 15 July. But Turkey people are now fed up with the AKP government. The AKP government has said there will be early elections on 24 June”.

The HDP, said Buldan, sees the elections on 24 June as an opportunity. “We are faced with a choice that will change the fate of Turkey. - said Buldan - We are faced with an election that will determine the next 10 years”.

The HDP, said Buldan, is running these elections “with a promise of hope and a promise to the people. Turkey needs peace. Turkey society needs peace, democracy, freedom. The one-man regime should not have a place in this country”.

Buldan added: “When our HDP lawmakers are in prison, when our municipal co-presidents are held hostage and are in prison we will stand united and offer an alternative to our society”.

Starting from İzmir, said Buldan, “I am to all the women and youth: come to our house. Our house is open to everybody. It is open to Armenians, Syrians, Alevis, Arabs, Laz, Circassian, Turks. Our party is not just a Kurdish party. Our party is open to all those who want to work together with us. It is our duty to change the history in this country and use this opportunity to shape a new future”.
