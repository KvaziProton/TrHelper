In its attempt to Turkifying everything reminding of Kurds in Afrin, Turkey has even changed the name of Avrin Hospital (in Kurdish Avrin Nexweşxaneya) into Turkish.

Speaking to Mesopotamia News Agency, Former hospital doctor Ebu Mihemed said: "Kurdish signs in the hospital were taken down and replaced with Turkish ones. They ca not even tolerate Kurdish names. They want to erase every trace of Kurdishness from Afrin. This is what is called occupation”.

Turkey and the Turkish-supported Free Syrian Army Turkey (FSA) continue their attacks against villages, districts, canton centres. At least 300 villages and centres have been burned and destroyed. The attacks against everything Kurdish continue.

After the destruction of the statue of Kawa the Blacksmith in Afrin, after the killings, rapes, torture, plunders now it was the turn of the Kurdish signs in Avrîn Hospital.

Ebu Mihemed, one of the doctors who worked in the hospital, said: “They want to change the demography of the region by destroying every trace of Kurdishness”.

Mihemed, who had been a gynecologist at Avrin Hospital for 6 years, said he had to treat dozens of injured people when the attacks against Afrin took place. Mihemed, himself from Afrin, stated that he remained in the city from the beginning of the attacks to their end.

Mihemed remembered with anguish the casualties, the wounded. Every day dozens of women and children were taken to the hospital to be treated. “Turkey and their islamist allies were targeting civilians, despite saying the contrary. In fact, they targeted Kurds” Mihemed said.

The doctor also underlined the deafening silence of the world. “Something which strikes us a lot - said Mihemed - because this massacre happened before the eyes of the world, yet nobody said anything”.

Mihemed confirmed that they are receiving news from Afrin. These are tales of horror, said the doctor: “People disappear, women are raped, people's property is confiscated, people are tortured, the world must see what they are doing to Kurds in Afrin. The press must go to Afrin and report, delegations must be formed and visit the city to tell the truth about the repression Kurds are suffering”.
