Drought and water supply problems are affecting the people of Iran. In the central Iranian province of Fars, the villages are being abandoned due to the lack of water supply.

Responsible for the villages in the Fars province, Kemal Pakfitrat, said that 4,000 of 8,000 villages had been evacuated. He said in an interview to the semi-official Iranian news agency Tasmim that the province has become virtually uninhabitable due to water supply problems and drought.

"Great lakes have dried up, the level in the dams has dropped"

Mohadese Hemeti from the Center of Natural Lakes in the province of Fars reports that due to the drought, the large lakes in the area have dried up and the level of the dams has dropped. He said that the largest lakes in the region, such as Bahtigan, Kamcan, Baxtir and Teshk, are completely dry: "The level of Maharlu dam fell by 50 percent and the Hirem dam by 30 percent.”

Pastures without water

However, the problems with water supply are not solely due to drought. The population is convinced that the problems also have political causes. According to official information, the pastures are affected in addition to the villages. Of 609 pastures, 355 have dried up.

Water supply problems must be solved

In the past few days, many demonstrations have taken place in the provinces of Isfahan, Xuzustan, Fars, Çarmahal and Bahtiyari to solve water supply problems.
