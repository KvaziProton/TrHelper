Women of Kobanê staged a march in protest at the Turkish state’s attacks on Rojava and the isolation of Kurdish People’s Leader Abdullah Öcalan.

With slogans saluting the Afrin resistance and condemning the isolation, women marched from Martyr Egid Square to Jina Azad Square.

Speaking here, Kongreya Star Kobane Coordination Member Felek Yusif condemned Turkey’s isolation of Kurdish People’s Leader Abdullah Öcalan and genocidal attacks against Afrin. She remarked that the Turkish state targeted the will of Northern Syria peoples and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria.

Saluting the resistance of Afrin’s women, Yusif said; “No one can crush the will of free women. The resistance of Afrin will prevail under the lead of women.” Yusif called on all women to enhance the struggle against invaders.

The demonstration ended with slogans saluting the resistance of women and Turkish invasion.
