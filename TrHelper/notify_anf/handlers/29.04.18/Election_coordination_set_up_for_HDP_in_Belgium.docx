“VOTES IN EUROPE CAN BE A VOICE AND A HOPE”

Participants said a strong voice from voters who will be voting in Europe earlier than Turkey could show that the AKP fascism can be taken down, and could provide a voice and hope for Turkey.

Until the elections, the coordination will actively campaign in all localities and hold public meetings in districts and squares and visit homes and businesses.

SUPPORT FOR TRAVEL TO CONSULATES

During voting in consulates, the coordination will be working on election security, and aid voters in travelling to consulates. The coordination is planning to tell the Belgian general public why these elections are important and increase support to stop the provocations and attacks by AKP members and gang groups seen in previous years. The coordination will also form an observation committee from Belgium to monitor the election process in Turkey.

WOMEN’S COORDINATION

Women from Turkey and Kurdistan in Belgium also came together and formed a Women’s Coordination. The coordination stated that the AKP has policies to roll back women’s gains and the social group attacked the most and affected the worst by the AKP government have been women, and stressed that the fall of the AKP fascism will come at the hands of women.
