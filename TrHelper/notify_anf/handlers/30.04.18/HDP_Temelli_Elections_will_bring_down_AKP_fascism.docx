Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) Co-Chair Sezai Temelli is touring provinces in Şırnak to carry out elections propaganda work for the next 24 June early elections. 

The HDP delegation toured the province of Silopi with a convoy of many cars on Monday morning. The crowd received the convoy with joy and interest while it was passing through the busy streets of the city. The convoy and the HDP executives were met with victory signs by dozens of people everywhere.

Students emptied the schools

After the city tour in Silopi, the delegation headed for Cizre where it was met with cheers by the people. Students had left their schools to support the HDP electoral meetings and kids on their bicycles opened the way to the convoy playing Kurdish songs. The city tour, full of colours and joyful scenes, ended to the HDP district building.

Massacres will not go unpunished

Temelli spoke to the people of Cizre, whose memories of the basement massacres are still hurting and alive. The HDP co-chair said: "The judiciary will do its job when it will be independent. When we are in power, we will ensure the responsible of these massacres pay for them. They think they can actually build upon the crimes they have committed. They think they can cover up their crimes”.

Erdoğan, you shall fall

Temelli then addressed directly AKP President and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğanm who said that “these elections will be a turning point”. Indeed, said Temelli, “mark the date, because 24 June will be a the turning point. So much so, that it will be the day of your fall".

Temelli went on to speak about the precarious state of the health system and the education system, reassuring people that “we will revert this. We see how the situation is in hospitals, we see schools were education standards actually come last”. 

Speaking about the alliance talks in Ankara, Temelli said: “The other are making speculations without counting the HDP. But without HDP there is no solution. They continue to see things from the right, but if they don’t begin to see things from the left perspective, then there will be no solution. The solution lies within workers, women, the youth of this country”.

HDP Co-Chairman Sezai Temelli ended his speech by saying: “We have a proposal for our friends who lost their lives, for our people. We are going to come. We are the way to freedom of these people. We urge all political structures, labor and democratic forces to fight shoulder to shoulder against fascism"
