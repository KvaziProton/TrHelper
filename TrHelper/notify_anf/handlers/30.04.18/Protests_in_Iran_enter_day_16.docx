On Monday protesters in Iran entered their 16th day of action against the prohibition of border trade and high custom taxes. 

The actions that started in the towns of Ciwanro and Bane of Rojhilat (Eastern Kurdistan), have already spread to Merîwan, Seqîz, Serdest and Pîranşar.

On Monday the protesters put up tents in Bane.

Tents are the new form to protest against the Iranian regime, said kolber (border traders), shopkeepers and artisans. 

The protesters said that the markets will not be reopened unless the Iranian regime removes the obstacles it has put on border trade. The regime, they said, keeps failing to meet their demands.

According to protesters the Iranian regime is not only killing kolbers engaged in cross-border trade, but it is now also hitting workers hard by closing borders and increasing customs taxes.

After 16 days of protest, the Iranian regime wants to end the actions carried out by workers, however it has taken no step to meet their demands nor to solve the problem. 

The workers have underlined that they will continue with their protest actions until the forces of the Iranian regime doesn’t agree to sit and talk the problems through.
